# code-refactor

## Description
It is important for websites to consider how the users consume the information. Websites should strive to be accessable to all users. 
Semantic html tags create a clear structure for the content on a web page to be easily parsed by machines. 
The goal of this project was to update the code, but not change the how it is displayed to the user. 
To accomplish this task I updated/added semantic html tags, inserted attributes, and consolidated the css sylte sheet attached. 
By changing the tags it alowed for better accessibility.
